####Backtracking — Knight’s Tour
A knight’s tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chess­board such that the knight vis­its every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight’s move from the begin­ning square (so that it could tour the board again imme­di­ately, fol­low­ing the same path), the tour is closed, oth­er­wise it is open.
