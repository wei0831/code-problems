####N Queens Problem - Backtracking
In chess, a queen can move as far as she pleases, hor­i­zon­tally, ver­ti­cally, or diag­o­nally. A chess board has 8 rows and 8 columns. The stan­dard 8 by 8 Queen’s prob­lem asks how to place 8 queens on an ordi­nary chess board so that none of them can hit any other in one move
